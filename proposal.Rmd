[link to data used](https://highered.ipums.org/highered/index.shtml)

Ive added 7 additional variables on top of the defaults to my data set. These consist of gender, minority status, ethnicity, highest degree or certificate, field of degree by group, salary, and job satisfaction

I intend to use this data to perform an analysis based around attributes of a person. I want to compare these variables in various combinations such as seeing how Race and Gender affect highest degree or to see the distribution of various ethnicity groups in different fields, or which degree group has the highest salary or job satisfaction etc... Im hoping this will provide some insight on different demographics in higher education and after graduation
