[link to data used](https://highered.ipums.org/highered/index.shtml)

Ive added 7 additional variables on top of the defaults to my dataset. These consist of gender, mimority status, ethnicity, highest degree or certificate, field of degree by group, salary, and job satisfacion

I intend to use this data to perform an analysis based around attributes of a person. I want to compare these variables in various combinations such as seeing how Race and Gender affect higest degree or  to see the distribution of various ethnicity groups in different fields,
